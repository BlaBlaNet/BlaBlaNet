  <dt>General</dt>
  <dd>The network page displays a stream of posts and conversations, typically ordered by the most recently updated. This page is highly customizable.</dd>
  <dt><a href='#' onclick='contextualHelpFocus("#profile-jot-wrapper", 0); return false;' title="Click to highlight element...">Create a Post</a></dt>
  <dd>At the top of the page there is a text box that says "Share". Clicking this box opens a new post editor. The post editor is customizable, but the basic editor provides fields for a post body and an optional post <b>Title</b>. Buttons below the text area to the left provide shortcuts to text formatting and inserting links, images, and other data into the post. The buttons to the right provide a post preview, the post permissions setting, and a <b>Submit</b> button to send the post.</dd>
  <dt><a href='#' onclick='contextualHelpFocus("#group-sidebar", 1); return false;' title="Click to highlight element...">Privacy Groups</a></dt>
  <dd>The privacy groups you have created are displayed in the side panel. Selecting them filters posts to those created by channels in the chosen group.</dd>
  <dt><a href='#' onclick='$("#dbtn-acl").click(); return false;' title="Click to highlight element...">Post Permissions</a></dt>
  <dd>The access control list (ACL) is what you use to set who can see your new post. Pressing the ACL button beside the Submit button will display a dialog in which you can select what channels and/or privacy groups can see the post. You can also select who is explicitly denied access. For example, say you are planning a surprise party for a friend. You can send an invitation post to everyone in your <b>Friends</b> group <i>except</i> the friend you are surprising. In this case you "show" the <b>Friends</b> group but "don't show" that one person.</dd>
