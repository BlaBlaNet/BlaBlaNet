    <dd>When you enable the Debugging option, system log information will begin appending to the file specified in the "Log File" box (path is relative to the hub root, for example /var/www). Note that this file must be writable by the web server.</dd>
    <dt>Log Level</dt>
    <dd>The log level option allows you to set how much information is appended to the log file. Warning: Increasing this level can quickly inflate the size of the log file to >100MB, especially on hubs with more than a few members.</dd>
