# Documentation To-Do List #

## How to contribute documentation ##

Documentation files are in */doc*.

When help is first accessed, the file loaded is *main.bb*. That file contains case sensitive links without an extension. The extensions is added automatically if the file is found, first *.md* then *.bb*.

For translating documentation, create a directory in */doc* named by the language code, copy the files and translate the content.
