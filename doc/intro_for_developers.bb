[b]How to theme $Projectname - by Olivier Migeot[/b]

This is a short documentation on what I found while trying to modify $Projectname's appearance.

First, you'll need to create a new theme. This is in /view/theme, and I chose to copy 'redbasic' since it's the only available for now. Let's assume I named it .

Oh, and don't forget to rename the _init function in /php/theme.php to be _init() instead of redbasic_init().

At that point, if you need to add javascript or css files, add them to /js or /css, and then &quot;register&quot; them in _init() through head_add_js('file.js') and head_add_css('file.css').

Now you'll probably want to alter a template. These can be found in in /view/tpl OR view//tpl. All you should have to do is copy whatever you want to tweak from the first place to your theme's own tpl directory.
