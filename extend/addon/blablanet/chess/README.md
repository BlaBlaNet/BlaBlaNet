[Hubzilla](http://hubzilla.org) is a powerful platform for creating interconnected websites featuring a decentralized identity, communications, and permissions framework built using common webserver technology. 

This plugin allows you to play chess games with anyone on the grid. The chess board mechanics are powered by [chessboard.js](http://chessboardjs.com), rendering a smooth and intuitive interface. Some gameplay features include a move history viewer, as well as the ability to end and resume games without deleting them.

Information about moves is propagated between players using the standard Hubzilla post system, so notifications of new games and opponent moves appear in your normal stream. You can also post messages in the conversation in a natural way as you play a game.
